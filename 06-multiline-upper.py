# Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines 
# after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 
# Hello world
# Practice makes perfect
# 
# Then, the output should be:
# 
# HELLO WORLD
# PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

lines = [???]                      # Creating a list of lines

    line = ???              # Taking input from user
    if line:                    # Checking if user has entered any string in input
        lines.???(line)      # If true, append to list of lines
