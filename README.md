# Python Lab
Each question has two versions. "xx-Question.py" where "xx" is serial number and "question" is question identity, contains helpful syntaxes but you need to complete the code by replacing "???" wherever required.
"xx-Question-solution.py" contains complete code and can be executed directly. 
Use Python 3 as default version unless otherwise stated.
